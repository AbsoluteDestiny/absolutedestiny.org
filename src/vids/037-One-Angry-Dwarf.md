description: 'Buddy nee Syndrome.'
lyrics: "September '75 I was 47 inches high\r\nMom said by Christmas I would have\r\nA bad-ass mother G.I. Joe\r\nFor your little minds to blow\r\nI still got beat up after class\r\n\r\nNow I'm big and important\r\nOne angry dwarf\r\nTwo hundred solemn faces are you\r\nIf you really wanna see me\r\nCheck your papers and the TV\r\nLook who's telling who what to do\r\nKiss my ass good-bye\r\n\r\nDon't give me that bullshit\r\nYou know who I am\r\nI'm your nightmare, little man\r\nVic, you stole my lunch money, made me cry\r\nJane, remember second grade?\r\nSaid you couldn't stand my face\r\nRather than kiss me\r\nYou said you'd rather die\r\n\r\nNow I'm big and important\r\nOne angry dwarf\r\nTwo hundred solemn faces are you\r\nIf you really wanna see me\r\nCheck your papers and the TV\r\nLook who's telling who what to do\r\nKiss my ass good-bye\r\n\r\nYou'll be sorry one day\r\nYes you will, yes you will\r\nYou shouldn't push me around\r\n'Cause I will, yes I will\r\nYou will be sorry when I'm big\r\nYes you will be sorry"
