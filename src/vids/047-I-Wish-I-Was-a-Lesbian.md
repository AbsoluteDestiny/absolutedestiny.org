lyrics: "OK, I'm riding around in this car with this woman that I'm close to a couple times a week. I'm noticing she's looking out of the window and noticing OTHER WOMEN: how this one looks, \"Isn't her hair lovely?\", \"What a nice outfit!\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"Babe, what is the DEAL?! You're noticing all these other chicks... maybe... you're a lesbian.\"\r\n\r\nShe looks at me and she says, \"I wish I was a lesbian!\"\r\n\r\nNow, at that point, I wanted to say, \"You mean 'you wish you WERE a lesbian' because, grammatically...\" But I let it slide; I didn't wanna ruffle any feathers.\r\n\r\nBut, y'know, that sentence, that retort, \"I wish I was a lesbian\"...kinda stuck in the ol' \"Laud-lo\"'s mind...kinda gestated there for...seven, eight minutes...AND THIS TUNE POPPED OUT!\r\n\r\nI wish I was a lesbian and not a hetero\r\nI wouldn't have to mess with men and all their come-and-go\r\nAnd all that awful facial hair and yucky \"ma-chis-mo\"\r\nOoooooo, I wish I was a lesbian and not a hetero\r\n\r\nI wish I was a lesbian and that I wasn't straight\r\nI would sleep with women only; man, that would be great\r\nI could throw away my diaphragm; I wouldn't wanna mate\r\nOoooooo, I wish I was a lesbian and that I wasn't straight\r\nHEEEEEEY!\r\n\r\nI wish I was a lesbian; I'd like to be a dyke\r\nI would hang with k.d. lang; Mel Gibson, take a hike\r\nI think it would be nice to love someone who was alike\r\nOoooooo, I wish I was a lesbian; I'd like to be a dyke\r\n\r\nI wish I was a lesbian; that's why this song is sung\r\nIt shouldn't have to matter how someone is hung\r\nOther things are more important...LIKE HOW TO USE YOR TOUNGE... blblblblblblblblblbl\r\nI wish I was a lesbian; that's why this song is sung\r\nHEEEEEEY!\r\n\r\n(I dare Casey Kasem to play this!)\r\n\r\nI wish I was a lesbian; I know it's sad, but true\r\nBut maybe I might understand you guys and all you do\r\nBut if I was a lesbian, I WOULDN'T HAVE TO\r\nI wish I was a lesbian; I know it's sad, but true\r\n\r\nHey, I wish I was a lesbian and not a hetero\r\nI wouldn't have to mess with men and all their come-and-go\r\nAnd all that awful facial hair and yucky \"ma-chis-mo\" (I hate that damned machismo!)\r\nOoooooo, I wish I was a lesbian and not a hetero\r\nI wish I was a lesbian and not a hetero\r\nI wish I was a lesbian and not a hetero!\r\nBlblblblblblblblblblblblblblbl."
