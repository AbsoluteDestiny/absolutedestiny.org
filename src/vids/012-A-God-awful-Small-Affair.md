lyrics: "It's a god-awful small affair\r\nTo the girl with the mousy hair\r\nBut her mummy is yelling, \"No!\"\r\nAnd her daddy has told her to go\r\nBut her friend is nowhere to be seen\r\nNow she walks through her sunken dream\r\nTo the seat with the clearest view\r\nAnd she's hooked to the silver screen\r\nBut the film is a saddening bore\r\nFor she's lived it ten times or more\r\nShe could spit in the eyes of fools\r\nAs they ask her to focus on\r\n\r\nSailors fighting in the dance hall\r\nOh man! Look at those cavemen go\r\nIt's the freakiest show\r\nTake a look at the lawman\r\nBeating up the wrong guy\r\nOh man! Wonder if he'll ever know\r\nHe's in the best selling show\r\nIs there life on Mars?"
