lyrics: "When I have a brand new hairdo\r\nWith my eyelashes all in curl,\r\nI float as the clouds on air do,\r\nI enjoy being a girl!\r\n\r\nWhen men say I'm cute and funny\r\nAnd my teeth aren't teeth, but pearl,\r\nI just lap it up like honey\r\nI enjoy being a girl!\r\n\r\nI flip when a fellow sends me flowers,\r\nI drool over dresses made of lace,\r\nI talk on the telephone for hours\r\nWith a pound and a half of cream upon my face!\r\n\r\nI'm strictly a female female\r\nAnd my future I hope will be\r\nIn the home of a brave and free male\r\nWho'll enjoy being a guy having a girl... like... me.\r\n\r\nI flip when a fellow sends me flowers,\r\nI drool over dresses made of lace,\r\nI talk on the telephone for hours\r\nWith a pound and a half of cream upon my face!\r\n\r\nWhen I have a brand new hairdo\r\nWith my eyelashes all in curl,\r\nI float as the clouds on air do,\r\nI enjoy being a girl!\r\n\r\nWhen someone with eyes that smoulder\r\nSays he loves ev'ry silken curl\r\nThat falls on my iv'ry shoulder,\r\nI enjoy being a girl!\r\n\r\nWhen I hear the compliment'ry whistle\r\nThat greets my bikini by the sea,\r\nI turn and I glower and I bristle,\r\nBut I happy to know the whistle's meant for me!"
