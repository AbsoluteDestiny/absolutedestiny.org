lyrics: "Old timer, Old timer\r\nIt's too late to die young now\r\nOld timer, five and dimer\r\nTrying to find a way to age like wine somehow\r\n\r\nmy new stuff is nothing like my old stuff was\r\nand neither one is much when compared to a show \r\nwhich will not be as good as another one you saw... \r\nso hell me, i know, i\r\nknow, i know\r\n\r\nI am an old timer, old timer\r\nit's too late to die young now\r\nold timer, five and dimer\r\ntrying to find a way to age like wine somehow\r\n\r\nI've met every fool that ever signed \r\ntheir name up on these walls\r\nin the backs of these beer joints and concert halls. \r\nI been through seven managers, \r\nfive labels, a thousand picks and patch cables, \r\nthree vans, a band, a bunch of guitar stands, \r\nand cans, and cans, and cans of beer,\r\nand bottles of boozes and bags of pot, \r\nand a thousand other things I forgot.\r\n\r\nI thought that I'd be dead by now... but I'm not."
