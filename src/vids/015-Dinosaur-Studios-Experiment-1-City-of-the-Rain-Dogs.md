lyrics: "Well it's Ninth and Hennepin\r\nAll the doughnuts have names that sound like prostitutes\r\nAnd the moon's teeth marks are on the sky\r\nLike a tarp thrown all over this\r\nAnd the broken umbrellas like dead birds\r\nAnd the steam comes out of the grill\r\nLike the whole goddamn town's ready to blow...\r\nAnd the bricks are all scarred with jailhouse tattoos\r\nAnd everyone is behaving like dogs\r\nAnd the horses are coming down Violin Road\r\nAnd Dutch is dead on his feet\r\nAnd all the rooms they smell like diesel\r\nAnd you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept here\r\nAnd I'm lost in the window, and I hide in the stairway\r\nAnd I hang in the curtain, and I sleep in your hat...\r\nAnd no one brings anything small into a bar around here\r\nThey all started out with bad directions\r\nAnd the girl behind the counter has a tattooed tear\r\nOne for every year he's away, she said\r\nSuch a crumbling beauty, ah\r\nThere's nothing wrong with her that a hundred dollars won't fix\r\nShe has that razor sadness that only gets worse\r\nWith the clang and the thunder of the Southern Pacific going by\r\nAnd the clock ticks out like a dripping faucet\r\ntil you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin\r\nAnd you spill out over the side to anyone who will listen...\r\nAnd I've seen it all, I've seen it all\r\nThrough the yellow windows of the evening train... "
