lyrics: "Have you ever stood outside a picket fence\r\nYou can see through\r\nBut you can't get to the inside, oh\r\nYou sit there and wait\r\nI look at you and anticipate\r\nWhat we could be and what we could do\r\n\r\nI'm carrying this heavy load\r\nDon't know what to do\r\nThe only thing I know\r\nIs I'm in love with you\r\nFly with the wings of an eagle\r\nNo matter how high\r\nI'll be thinking of you\r\n\r\nFly the wings of an eagle\r\nNo matter how high\r\nI'll be thinking of you the whole time\r\nOh\r\nYou'll be on my mind all the time\r\nOh\r\nYou'll be on my mind\r\nI'll be thinking of you the whole time"
