lyrics: "[Everything In Its Right Place]\r\nEverything,\r\nEverything\r\n\r\n[Planet Telex]\r\nYou can force it but it will not come\r\nYou can taste it but it will not form\r\n(Chasing you home)\r\nEverything is broken\r\nEveryone is broken\r\n\r\n[2+2=5]\r\nI'll stay home forever\r\nWhere two and two\r\nAlways make a five\r\n\r\n[Instrumental from No Surprises]\r\n\r\n[Optimistic]\r\nYou can try the best you can\r\nYou can try the best you can\r\nThe best you can is good enough\r\nYou can try the best you can\r\nYou can try the best you can\r\nThe best you can is good enough\r\nThe best you can is good enough\r\nThe best you can is good enough...\r\n\r\n[You And Whose Army?]\r\nWe rise tonight, we ride tonight\r\nWe rise tonight, we ride tonight\r\n\r\n[Karma Police]\r\nThis is what you get\r\nThis is what you get\r\nThis is what you get, when you mess with us\r\n\r\n[Knives Out]\r\nKnives out, catch the mouse\r\nSquash his head, throw him in the-\r\n\r\n[Creep]\r\nShe's running out again\r\n(So effin' special)\r\nShe's running out\r\nShe runs (runs!)\r\nRuns (runs!)\r\nRuns (run baby, run!)\r\n\r\n[Instrumental from The National Anthem]\r\n\r\n[Morning Bell]\r\nRelease me, release me\r\nCut the kids in half (come on!)\r\nCut the kids in half\r\nCut the kids in half\r\n\r\n[How To Disappear Completely]\r\nThat there, that's not me\r\nI go where I please\r\nI'm not here\r\n\r\n[Instrumental from Just]\r\n\r\n[Fake Plastic Trees]\r\nShe looks like the real thing\r\nShe tastes like the real thing\r\nMy fake plastic girl\r\n\r\n[Nice Dream]\r\nNice dream\r\n(If you think that you're strong enough)\r\nNice dream\r\n(If you think you belong enough)\r\nNice dream\r\nCome on!\r\n\r\n[Paranoid Android]\r\nThat's it, sir! You're leaving\r\nThe crackle of pigskin\r\nThe dust and the screaming\r\nThem yuppies networking\r\nThe panic, the vomit\r\nThe panic, the vomit\r\nGod loves his children\r\n(Copy that, God loves his children. 10-4.)\r\n\r\n[Instrumental from Subterranean Homesick Alien]\r\n"
