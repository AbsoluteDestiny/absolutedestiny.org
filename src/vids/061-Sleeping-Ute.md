title: 'Sleeping Ute'
description: 'But I can''t help myself...'
lyrics: "Dreamed a long day\r\nJust wandering free\r\nThough I'm far gone\r\nYou sleep nearer to me\r\n\r\nIf I could find peace\r\nIf this night bleeds\r\nBut I can't help myself\r\n\r\nSo I walk out\r\nThese wandering dreams\r\nIf I could lie still\r\nAs that grey hill\r\nBut I can't help myself\r\n\r\nBut it's calm and it's clear\r\nCollapsed here on the stone\r\nDelivered to this place\r\nA vision dark and cloaked\r\n\r\nAnd those figures through the leaves\r\nAnd that light through the smoke\r\nAnd those countless empty days\r\nAnd I dizzy when I woke\r\nAnd I live to see your face\r\nAnd I hate to see you go\r\nBut I know no other way\r\nThan straight on out the door\r\n\r\nAnd I can't help myself\r\nAnd I can't help myself\r\nAnd I can't help myself"
