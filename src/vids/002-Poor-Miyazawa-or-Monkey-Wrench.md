description: 'Kare Kano (as it is known) is such fun to make videos with due to the massive amounts of visual comedy. I later remastered this one a tiny tiny bit and added some, not particularly necessary, fancy additions and tweaked the timing a touch. Still a video I enjoy but technically flawed in many ways.'
lyrics: "What have we done with innocence\r\nIt disappeared with time, it never made much sense\r\nAdolescent resident\r\nWasting another night on planning my revenge\r\n\r\nOne in ten, One in ten, One in ten\r\n\r\nDon't want to be your monkey wrench\r\nOne more indecent accident\r\nI'd rather leave than suffer this\r\nI'll never be your monkey wrench\r\n\r\nAll this time to make amends\r\nWhat do you do when all your enemies are friends\r\nNow and then I'll try to bend\r\nUnder pressure wind up snapping in the end\r\n\r\nOne in ten, One in ten, One in ten\r\n\r\nDon't want to be your monkey wrench\r\nOne more indecent accident\r\nI'd rather leave than suffer this\r\nI'll never be your monkey wrench\r\n\r\nOne last thing before I quit\r\nI never wanted any more than I could fit\r\nInto my head I still remember every single word\r\nYou said and all the shit that somehow came along with it\r\nStill there's one thing that comforts me since I was\r\nAlways caged and now I'm free\r\n\r\nDon't want to be your monkey wrench\r\nOne more indecent accident\r\nI'd rather leave than suffer this\r\nI'll never be your monkey wrench\r\n\r\nDon't want to be your monkey wrench (fall in, fall out)\r\nDon't want to be your monkey wrench (fall in, fall out)\r\nDon't want to be your monkey wrench (fall in, fall out)\r\nDon't want to be your monkey wrench\r\n"
