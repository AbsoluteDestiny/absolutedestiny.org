lyrics: "There is too much light in this bar\r\nI can see the black on white of this page beckoning me to scrawl\r\nan old Devo song on the jukebox\r\nold Devo? What a paradox!\r\nA strange, futuristic reminiscence\r\nbut Mongoloid sure takes me back...\r\nThere is too much light in this bar.\r\n\r\nA woman lights a cigarette, pale and dramatic\r\nLipstick thick pout\r\nThe waft of smoke sticks needles in my memory\r\nI used to smoke to be cool, in seventh grade\r\nwhen a girl called Amy wore lace up the-\r\nfront and back hip-hugger bellbottoms and a crocheted halter\r\nMe trying deperately to hide\r\nmy walking-down-the-hall out of control puberty boner\r\nwith a math book\r\nand now a woman walks by with the EXACT SAME OUTFIT ON\r\nlooking so ever so retro thrift-store hip!\r\nThere is too much light in this bar!\r\n\r\nToo much light, too much vibe, too many haircuts, too much leather,\r\ntoo much 'blah blah blah' and drunken shrieks and trendy music\r\npumping through the Great Altar of Mumble\r\na nauseating Generation X-marks-the-G-spot dating ritual\r\nand I wonder if either of them have a rubber on them\r\nGod I hope so\r\nThere is too much light in this bar!\r\n\r\nYou couldn't cut through the attitude with a syringe\r\nand I'm just about to start screaming, at the top of my lungs\r\n\"Hey, let's all wear fake paratrooper boots and grass as far down as we possibly can\"\r\nand see who can be the most smoulderingly pissy\r\nand even though we all share the same epidemic BOREDOM and APATHY\r\nwe still have the GUMPTION to call ourselves\r\nALLLLLLLLTERNATIVE!!!\r\n\r\nWhen suddenly\r\nDicko Suave\r\nGuitar player for The Rockbusters and a serious. hardcore. mother-fucker.\r\nfrom way back.\r\nwalks, no wait\r\nSWAGGERS into the room, like a gunfighter with too many bullets\r\nand as the jukebox pauses between songs\r\nhe screams\r\n\"I'm here to do heroin and FUCK...\r\nand I'm all outta heroin.\"\r\nHe picks the closest, most pretentious person\r\nwho is me, sitting, writing in my sketch book\r\ngrabs me off my barstool and begins to hump\r\nfuriously\r\nat my leg\r\nand now I know for sure there is\r\nWAYYYYYYYY too much light in this bar."
