lyrics: "At first I see an open wound,\r\ninfected and disastrous.\r\nIt breathes chaotic catastrophe,\r\nit cries to be renewed.\r\n(Please Renew Me!)\r\nIts tears are the colour of anger,\r\nthey dry to form a scab.\r\nTo the touch, its stiff and resilient,\r\nunderneath, the new skin breathes.\r\n\r\nIts all been saved...\r\nwith exception for the right parts.\r\nWhen will we be new skin?\r\n\r\nAs outwardly cliche as it may seem,\r\nyes, something under the surface says,\r\n\"C'est la vie.\"\r\nIt is a circle, there is a plan...\r\ndead skin will atrophy itself to start again.\r\nLook closely at the open wound...\r\nsee past what covers the surface\r\nUnderneath chaotic catastrophe,\r\ncreation takes stage.\r\n\r\nDead skin will atrophy itself to start again.\r\nDead skin will atrophy itself to start again.\r\nDead skin will atrophy itself to start again.\r\n\r\nIts all been saved...\r\nwith exception for the right parts.\r\nWhen will we be new skin?\r\n\r\nIts all been seen...\r\nwith exception for what could be.\r\nWhen will we be new skin?\r\n\r\nuntil the 20th century, reality was everything humans could touch, smell, see,\r\nand hear.\r\nsince the inital publication of the charged electromagnetic spectrum, humans\r\nlearned that what they can touch, smell, see, and hear...is less than one\r\nmillionth of reality.\r\n\r\nFallacious cognitions,\r\nspewed from televisions,\r\ndo mold our decisions.\r\nSo stop and take a look,\r\nand you'll see what I see now.\r\n\r\nIts all been saved...\r\nwith exception for the right parts.\r\nWhen will we be new skin?\r\n\r\nIts all been seen...\r\nwith exception for what could be.\r\nWhen will we be new skin? skin?"
