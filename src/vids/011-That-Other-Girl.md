lyrics: "I have to say that we should finish it now\r\nBefore we weaken 'cause we\r\nalready know this is wrong\r\nI could give in\r\nSometimes I think that I will\r\nDespite the temptation I try to be very strong\r\nIf my reluctance seems a surprise\r\nIt's not 'cause I don't want you\r\nBut I just\r\nKnow I must\r\nHesitate\r\nBecause I still have that\r\nother girl in my head\r\nI still have that other girl in my head\r\n\r\nThere may be ugly rumors\r\nthat I have been lying\r\nThere may be angry tears but\r\nthey're never worth the crying\r\nThat is why\r\nSometimes\r\nI hesitate\r\nBecause I still have that\r\nother girl in my head\r\nI still have that other girl in my head\r\nI still have that other girl in my head"
