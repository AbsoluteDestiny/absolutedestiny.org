lyrics: "Lets boogie\r\n\r\nHe's got style, he's got flare\r\nGot two left feet but he doesn't care\r\nDressed in blue, fit to form\r\nLadies love to touch his uniform\r\nMess with him and your outta luck\r\nHe's a macho duck\r\n\r\nMacho macho duck\r\nOh he's a manly sensation\r\nMacho macho duck\r\nHe's a macho macho duck\r\n\r\nCan he move, well guess what?\r\nWatch his wiggle waddle strut\r\nBut feathers fly when he gets riled\r\nIt's like a pillow fight of white\r\n\r\nMacho macho duck\r\nThe slickest bird in the nation\r\nMacho macho duck\r\nHe's a macho macho duck"
