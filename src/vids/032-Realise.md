lyrics: "One, two, three, four -\r\nDo You Realize - that you have the most beautiful face\r\nDo You Realize - we're floating in space -\r\nDo You Realize - that happiness makes you cry\r\nDo You Realize - that everyone you know someday will die\r\n\r\nAnd instead of saying all of your goodbyes - let them know\r\nYou realize that life goes fast\r\nIt's hard to make the good things last\r\nYou realize the sun don'-go down\r\nIt's just an illusion caused by the world spinning round\r\n\r\nDo You Realize - Oh - Oh - Oh\r\nDo You Realize - that everyone you know\r\nSomeday will die -\r\n\r\nAnd instead of saying all of your goodbyes - let them know\r\nYou realize that life goes fast\r\nIt's hard to make the good things last\r\nYou realize the sun don'-go down\r\nIt's just an illusion caused by the world spinning round\r\n\r\nDo You Realize - that you have the most beautiful face\r\nDo You Realize"
