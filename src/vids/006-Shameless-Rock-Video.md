lyrics: "\"Good golly\", said Little Miss Molly\r\nWhen she was rockin' in the House Of Blue Light\r\nTutti Frutti was, oh, so rooty\r\nRockin' to the east and west\r\n\r\nLucille was, oh, so real\r\nWhen she didn't do her daddy's will\r\nCome on, baby, drive me crazy, do it, do it\r\n\r\n'Cause I'm a Speed King, you've got to hear me sing\r\nYeah, I'm a Speed King, see me fly\r\n\r\n'Cause I'm a Speed King, you've got to hear me sing\r\nYeah, I'm a Speed King, see me fly\r\nI'm a Speed King, you've got to hear me sing\r\n\r\nYeah, I'm a Speed King, see me"

This is the video that got me known among anime music video creators and it's something of an anthem video for me. FLCL is in my mind one of the finest Psychotronic works and this was a chance for me to play with its themes and have a lot of fun.
