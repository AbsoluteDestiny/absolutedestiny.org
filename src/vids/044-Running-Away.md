lyrics: "We shake it...\r\nWe take it..\r\nwith pride\r\nand show!\r\nWe like it...\r\nexciting\r\nand ready\r\nto go!\r\n\r\nI'm projecting and reflecting desire\r\nfor you to come into my life.\r\nThe rays of this day will outshine them all\r\nfor me and you to get along.\r\n\r\nIt's like running away with the wind in our face, it's like flying\r\n(flying!)\r\nand you and I are open wide.\r\nIt's like running away with the wind in our face, it's like flying\r\n(flying!)\r\nand you and I are open wide.\r\n\r\nI feel so excited and delighted today\r\n'cause you decided to be in my life.\r\nIt's like running away with the wind in our face, it's like flying\r\n(flying!)\r\nand you and I are open wide.\r\n\r\nThe show...\r\nthe electric show!\r\n\r\nI get around the world upon your freeways\r\nit's true when you let it go.\r\nI get around the world upon your freeways\r\nit's true when you let it go."
