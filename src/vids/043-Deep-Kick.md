lyrics: "It started when we were\r\nlittle kids free spirits but\r\nalready tormented by our own hands\r\ngiven to us by our parents we got together\r\nand wrote on desks and slept in laundry\r\nrooms near snowy mountains & slipped through\r\nwhatever cracks we can find minds altered\r\nwe didn't falter in portraying hysterical\r\nand tragic characters in a smog filled\r\nuniverse we loved the dirty city and the\r\njourneys away from it we had not yet been\r\nor seen our friends selves chase tails round\r\nand round in downward spiral leaving trail\r\nof irretrievable vital life juice behind still\r\nthe brothersbloodcomradespartnerfamilycuzz\r\nwas impenetrable\r\nand we lived inside it laughing with no clothes\r\nand everything experimental 'till death was\r\nupon us in our face mortality and\r\nlots of things seemed futile then but\r\nlove and music can save us and did while\r\nthe giant grey monster grew more poisoned\r\nand volatile around us jaws clamping down\r\nand spewing ugly shit around nothing\r\nis the same so we keep moving\r\nwe keep moving\r\n\r\nWent off and got some hair cuts\r\nLookin' wild & got all drugged up\r\nHopped a train into the night\r\nGot a ride with a transvestite\r\nTwo boys in San Francisco\r\nTwo boys in San Francisco\r\nBlasted off in a BART bathroom\r\nThose coppers woke us up\r\nMotherfuckers woke us up\r\n\r\nTwo young brothers on a hover craft\r\nTelepathics love and belly laughs\r\n\r\nWe went to Fairfax High School\r\nJumped off buildings into their pools\r\nWe'd sit down and grease at Canters\r\nRun like hell they can't catch us\r\nTwo boys in London, England\r\nTwo boys in London, England\r\nClimbing out of hostel windows\r\nWearing gear so out but in though\r\nCome on kid and do the no no\r\n\r\nTwo young brothers on a hover craft\r\nTelepathics, love and belly laughs\r\n\r\nI remember 10 years ago\r\nIn Hollywood we did some good\r\nand we did some real bad stuff\r\nbut the Butthole Surfers\r\nsaid it's better to regret\r\nSomething you did\r\nthan something you didn't do\r\nyeah, we were young and we\r\nwere looking for the deep kick...\r\nSeen 'em come seen 'em go\r\n\r\n(and I feel like getting close to you)"
