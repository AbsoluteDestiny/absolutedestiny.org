lyrics: "Run now quickly doin' my thing\r\nWe're on the case, we like the man for the behaviour\r\nWhat you doing over there,\r\nCome on let's do this, rip the air\r\n\r\nYou'll all feel this latest groove\r\nAnd then just don't know what to do\r\nHey bro, what you got in your hand?\r\nMan that's amazin', put it away it's gonna\r\nGo bang, blow my brains, HA\r\nI'm gonna soak 'em in pain\r\nWith the S.D.X\r\n\r\nSo...\r\nLet's leave a little bit of change\r\nThe tramps can fear us \r\nStay boarded up in their special caves\r\nJust how far are they gonna stay sane\r\nCut the drugs, uh!"
