title: 'Memories of Love and Conflict'
description: 'Ill-fated teen romance and dreamland melodrama abound.'
lyrics: "This is our last goodbye\r\nI hate to feel the love between us die.\r\nBut it's over\r\nJust hear this and then I'll go:\r\nYou gave me more to live for,\r\nMore than you'll ever know.\r\n\r\nWell, this is our last embrace,\r\nMust I dream and always see your face?\r\nWhy can't we overcome this wall?\r\nBaby, maybe it's just because I didn't know you at all.\r\n\r\nKiss me, please kiss me,\r\nBut kiss me out of desire, babe, and not consolation.\r\nOh, you know it makes me so angry 'cause I know that in time\r\nI'll only make you cry, this is our last goodbye.\r\n\r\nDid you say, \"No, this can't happen to me\"?\r\nAnd did you rush to the phone to call?\r\nWas there a voice unkind in the back of your mind saying,\r\n\"Maybe, you didn't know him at all,\r\nyou didn't know him at all,\r\noh, you didn't know\"?\r\n\r\nWell, the bells out in the church tower chime,\r\nBurning clues into this heart of mine.\r\nThinking so hard on her soft eyes, and the memories\r\nOffer signs that it's over, it's over."
