title: 'Rock Lobster'
description: 'for Jetpack Monkey'
lyrics: "We were at the beach\r\nEverybody had matching towels\r\nSomebody went under a dock\r\nAnd there they saw a rock\r\n\r\nIt wasn't a rock\r\nIt was a rock lobster\r\n\r\nRock lobster\r\nRock lobster\r\n\r\nRock lobster\r\nRock lobster\r\n\r\nMotion in the ocean\r\nHis air hose broke\r\nLots of trouble\r\nLots of bubble\r\n\r\nHe was in a jam\r\nHe's in a giant clam\r\n\r\nRock, rock\r\nRock lobster\r\nDown, down\r\n\r\nHere comes a stringray\r\nThere goes a manta ray\r\nIn walked a jelly fish\r\nThere goes a dogfish\r\n\r\nChased by a catfish\r\nIn flew a sea robin\r\nWatch out for that piranha\r\nThere goes a narwhal\r\nHere comes a bikini whale\r\n\r\nRock lobster\r\nRock lobster\r\nRock lobster\r\nRock lobster"
