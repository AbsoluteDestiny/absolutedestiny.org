lyrics: "Wake up in the morning feeling like P Diddy\r\n(Hey, what up girl?)\r\nGrab my glasses, I'm out the door, I'm gonna hit this city\r\n(Lets go)\r\nBefore I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack\r\n'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't coming back\r\n\r\nI'm talking pedicure on our toes, toes\r\nTrying on all our clothes, clothes\r\nBoys blowing up our phones, phones\r\nDrop-topping, playing our favorite CDs\r\nPulling up to the parties\r\nTrying to get a little bit tipsy\r\n\r\nDon't stop, make it pop\r\nDJ, blow my speakers up\r\nTonight, I'mma fight\r\n'Til we see the sunlight\r\nTick tock on the clock\r\nBut the party don't stop, no\r\n\r\nDon't stop, make it pop\r\nDJ, blow my speakers up\r\nTonight, I'mma fight\r\n'Til we see the sunlight\r\nTick tock, on the clock\r\nBut the party don't stop, no\r\n\r\nAin't got a care in world, but got plenty of beer\r\nAin't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here\r\nAnd now, the dudes are lining up cause they hear we got swagger\r\nBut we kick em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger\r\n\r\nI'm talking about everybody getting crunk, crunk\r\nBoys tryin' to touch my junk, junk\r\nGonna smack him if he getting too drunk, drunk\r\n\r\nNow, now, we go until they kick us out, out\r\nOr the police shut us down, down\r\nPolice shut us down, down\r\nPo-po shut us\r\n\r\nDon't stop, make it pop\r\nDJ, blow my speakers up\r\nTonight, I'mma fight\r\n'Til we see the sunlight\r\nTick tock on the clock\r\nBut the party don't stop, no\r\n\r\nDJ, you build me up\r\nYou break me down\r\nMy heart, it pounds\r\nYeah, you got me\r\n\r\nWith my hands up\r\nYou got me now\r\nYou got that sound\r\nYeah, you got me\r\n\r\nDJ, you build me up\r\nYou break me down\r\nMy heart, it pounds\r\nYeah, you got me\r\n\r\nWith my hands up\r\nPut your hands up\r\nPut your hands up\r\n\r\nNow, the party don't start 'til I walk in\r\n\r\nDon't stop, make it pop\r\nDJ, blow my speakers up\r\nTonight, I'mma fight\r\n'Til we see the sunlight\r\nTick tock on the clock\r\nBut the party don't stop, no\r\n\r\nDon't stop, make it pop\r\nDJ, blow my speakers up\r\nTonight, I'mma fight\r\n'Til we see the sunlight\r\nTick tock on the clock\r\nBut the party don't stop, no"
