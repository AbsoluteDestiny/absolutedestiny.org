lyrics: "Soldier is turning\r\nSee him through white light\r\nWar upon war\r\nHeat upon heat\r\nTo cut a long story short\r\nI lost my mind\r\n\r\nSitting on a park bench\r\nYears away from fighting\r\nTo cut a long story short\r\nI lost my mind\r\n\r\nStanding in the dark\r\nOh I was waiting for man to come\r\nI am beautiful and clean\r\nAnd so very very young\r\nTo be standing in the street\r\nTo be taken by someone\r\n\r\nQuestions questions\r\nGive me no answers\r\nThatâ€™s all they ever give me\r\nQuestions questions\r\nOh look at the strange boy\r\nHe finds it hard existing\r\nTo cut a long story short\r\nI lost my mind"

This video is a character profile of two characters from animations directed by Hideaki Anno done in the style of his post-Nadia work. As such, it's very stylised and not to everyone's taste. Despite being essentially an experimental video, it was very well received and is one of my favourites.
