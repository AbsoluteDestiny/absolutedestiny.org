1
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:09,410
I'm a dreamer... hidden power...

2
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:25,770
My world... made of dreams, love and uncertainty

3
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:36,210
but there are things lying hidden that I cannot imagine.

4
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:47,320
Just like the trees, I face the sky, gazing straight at you.

5
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:53,080
I want to find my dream... I want to make it come true.

6
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:59,140
There is nothing I can't overcome if only I believe.

7
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:04,250
Just like singing... just like miracles

8
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:10,160
feelings can change everything.

9
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:18,390
I'm sure, so sure... it's surprising.

10
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:37,280
I'm a dreamer... hidden power...

11
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,290
A world yet unseen...

12
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:54,760
no matter what awaits me there

13
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:03,950
even if it's not perfect, I won't be afraid.

14
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:10,160
Birds travel on the wind,

15
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:15,270
on a journey from today to tomorrow.

16
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:20,880
I want to tell you... I want to shout it.

17
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,990
I am only one person in this world

18
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:37,770
but like a prayer, like a star, the smallest lights

19
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:45,500
want to become stronger someday.

20
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:06,060
There are limitless possibilities... right here in my grasp.

21
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,790
It's gonna be your world.

22
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,700
Just like singing, just like miracles

23
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:30,430
feelings can change everything.

24
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:40,390
I'm sure, so sure... it's surprising.
