1
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,480
We shake it...

2
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:38,950
We take it..

3
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,670
with pride

4
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,980
and show!

5
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,730
We like it...

6
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,330
exciting

7
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,770
and ready

8
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,890
to go!

9
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:06,590
I'm projecting and reflecting desire

10
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:12,000
for you to come into my life.

11
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,390
The rays of this day will outshine them all

12
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:25,580
for me and you to get along.

13
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:33,110
 It's like running away with the wind in our face, it's like flying

14
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,130
(flying!)

15
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,950
and you and I are open wide.

16
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:47,360
It's like running away with the wind in our face, it's like flying

17
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,950
(flying!)

18
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,760
and you and I are open wide.

19
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:18,030
I feel so excited and delighted today

20
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,000
'cause you decided to be in my life.

21
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:30,970
It's like running away with the wind in our face, it's like flying

22
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,420
(flying!)

23
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:37,760
and you and I are open wide.

24
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,170
The show...

25
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,800
the electric show!

26
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:18,630
I get around the world upon your freeways

27
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:24,260
it's true when you let it go.

28
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:32,230
I get around the world upon your freeways

29
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:38,310
it's true when you let it go.
