I'm a dreamer... hidden power...

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:25.770 line:93%
My world... made of dreams, love and uncertainty

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:36.210 line:93%
but there are things lying hidden that I cannot imagine.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:47.320 line:93%
Just like the trees, I face the sky, gazing straight at you.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.080 line:93%
I want to find my dream... I want to make it come true.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:59.140 line:93%
There is nothing I can't overcome if only I believe.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.250 line:93%
Just like singing... just like miracles

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.160 line:93%
feelings can change everything.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:18.390 line:93%
I'm sure, so sure... it's surprising.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:37.280 line:93%
I'm a dreamer... hidden power...

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.290 line:93%
A world yet unseen...

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.760 line:93%
no matter what awaits me there

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:03.950 line:93%
even if it's not perfect, I won't be afraid.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.160 line:93%
Birds travel on the wind,

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.270 line:93%
on a journey from today to tomorrow.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.880 line:93%
I want to tell you... I want to shout it.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.990 line:93%
I am only one person in this world

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:37.770 line:93%
but like a prayer, like a star, the smallest lights

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:45.500 line:93%
want to become stronger someday.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:06.060 line:93%
There are limitless possibilities... right here in my grasp.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.790 line:93%
It's gonna be your world.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.700 line:93%
Just like singing, just like miracles

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.430 line:93%
feelings can change everything.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:40.390 line:93%
I'm sure, so sure... it's surprising.
