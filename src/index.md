# About Me

I've been making fan work under the name AbsoluteDestiny since around 2001\. Starting with work in the anime community, I did a small amount of Fansub work before focussing heavily on <dfn><abbr title="Anime Music Videos">AMVs</abbr></dfn>, of which I produced a significant number.

Of late, I have been involved with, <dfn><abbr title="live action fan music video making">vidding</abbr></dfn>, and while I do still have keen interests in anime, my music video production has moved more toward live action film and television.

I've made **66 videos** so far. Which isn't a lot given how long I've been doing this.

My fanlore profile [is here](http://fanlore.org/wiki/User:AbsoluteDestiny).

## Blog

I keep a not-very-regularly-updated blog [here on dreamwidth](http://absolutedestiny.dreamwidth.org).

## Permission for vid use

If you wish to show one of my works at a fan convention, you have my consent.
